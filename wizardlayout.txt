Notes:
generate thumbnails!

start with examples --> thumbnail of each example
   THEN customize
   THEN start making variations --> thumbnail or example of just one setting at a time

trick: the initial state dedicates large area to showing lots of possibilities.
its too hard for the user to click each of the items in the top level one at a time. initial set needs
     to 'show off' whats possible

trick 2: you really end up having to have defaults set for each level in the configuration tree

trick 3: at some point, you stop letting them opt in, and you just launch 'customize' where you walk through all options
one at a time

trick 4: you need thumbnails that illustrate WHAT a setting is-- like dimensions for widths etc

trick 5: visualizing the grid choices can be done with a single square,
but honestly just rendering the whole thing is probably good enough!!!

trick 6: change from home-grown styles to css styles?

trick 7: use css style sto simplify config, and tinycss to parse and convert to the pdf
